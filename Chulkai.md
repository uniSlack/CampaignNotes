Humans from the far flung future
9 feet tall on average
Grey skin, spindly limbs, eyes close together like hyper predator
Despite appearance still incredibly strong and tough
Highly advanced tech
	So advanced that the tech doesn't work in any environment with dense mana
		Any time period in their 'past' has dense mana
While their tech often flounders in other time periods, they desperately want the dense mana of those times as a power source in their 'heat death-ed' time line.
