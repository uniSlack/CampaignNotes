three women dwelling within the great confines of the Kings' castle. 
A girl, a woman, and an elder
The girl sheers sheep, the woman spins yarn, and the elder weaves it
The party gets to choose who to get their fortune from. 
The girl gives a crook which master's any beast it loops around their neck
The woman gives 60 feet of unbreakable rope
The elder gives fine spun cloaks that can weather any natural elements
