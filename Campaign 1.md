[[Player Intro 1]]
Savage worlds
Set in [[Aeltzar]] out of time.
Cannon human time is 2011
[[Chulkai]] are main antagonist
PC's got pulled into the city 
	When they got pulled from their worlds they are arrested and brought before the council. 
	Turns out their method of travel, consensual or not, is highly illegal.
	They have suicide collars put on their throats.
	It is so illegal because their summoning also summons a Aeltzar resident to a different world. Which is almost always a disaster
	As is the long running prophecy, only the ones brought to Aeltzar may undo what their [[The Shades|shades]] have wrought. They legally are required to go deal with their counter parts

REAL reason players have to chase baddies. The teleportation portal's can only hone in on the plan if all being ported are interlopers. With none it can't track, and with extras it is likely to whiff
