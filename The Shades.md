First: Murdohobo (Cyberpunk?) gets sent to magical fairyland
^ I think remove this and just have the wizard. Foreshadow time manipulation, then write it as if they have to go save the member from being sent to the evil wizard, when really the interloper is the wizard. But he's been stuck their for hundreds of years

Second: Powerful wizard gets sent to land where mana is thin. Time passes slowly there, and his dense mana causes him to kill those he is near. So he secludes himself in his high tower and has his golems build a castle around him to stave off the populace. After hundreds of years he just goes crazy and turns into the mad mage. This will be a more traditional dungeon crawl

Third: Princess gets sent to a land where she has to unite disparate forces against a true evil, but before she can get far the Fourth shade finds her and kidnaps her. 

He is the one who started the ritual. The murder hobo was a test. The Wizard a raid for supplies, his true goal being the princess. Her blood is queenly, and capable of opening portals so more may walk through them, and the Chulkai need that. When the players find her she has already been mostly drained, and the blood shipped off. The fourth evil was simply going to keep her around, for his own nefarious purposes.
